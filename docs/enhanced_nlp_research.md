# Enhancing Content Recommendation with Advanced NLP Techniques

## Overview
The objective of this research is to explore advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a focus on BERT embeddings, to enhance the accuracy and relevance of our content recommendation engine. We aim to compare the effectiveness of traditional TF-IDF vectorization against BERT embeddings and determine the best approach for our system.

## Motivation
Our current content recommendation engine relies on TF-IDF vectorization, which may not fully capture the semantic richness of the content. By integrating BERT embeddings, we hope to achieve a deeper understanding of the text, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations.

## Research Goals
1. **Understand BERT Embeddings**: Gain a comprehensive understanding of how BERT embeddings work and how they can be applied to content analysis.
2. **Benchmark Performance**: Compare the recommendation accuracy and relevance between TF-IDF vectorization and BERT embeddings.
3. **Identify Implementation Changes**: Determine the necessary changes to the recommendation engine pipeline to accommodate BERT embeddings.

## Implementation Plan
Based on the research outcomes, we plan to:
- Integrate BERT embeddings into the recommendation engine, requiring new code for embedding extraction and similarity calculation.
- Adjust the model training pipeline to include BERT embeddings, which may involve data preprocessing adjustments and similarity computation optimizations.
- Conduct a thorough performance evaluation of the updated recommendation engine.

## Jira Tasks
