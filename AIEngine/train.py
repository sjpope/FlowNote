Title: Environmental Science - Global Warming
Definition: Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.
Causes: The main cause of global warming is industrial activities that emit CO2, deforestation, and agricultural practices.
Effects: Significant effects include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity.
Summary: Global warming is an ongoing increase in Earth temperature, largely due to CO2 emissions from human activities, resulting in climatic changes and ecological impacts.
